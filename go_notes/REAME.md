### Go Philosophy


### Reusable packages
The design philosophy of Go is to build reusable pieces of code as packages, and make your application using these packages. Go programs are organized into directories called packages. Go encourages you to perform software composition by composing individual pieces of Go packages as an application. Go packages enable code reusability, modularity and better maintainability.
